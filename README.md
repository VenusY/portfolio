# Portfolio

[Link to portfolio](https://venusy.github.io/portfolio/)

Welcome to my portfolio! This is a space where I showcase who I am, my skills, 
and some of my featured projects. I built this website to highlight my journey 
as a frontend developer and to experiment with building an intuitive and visually 
appealing user interface.

The site was built with HTML, Sass, and JavaScript.

## Key Features

### Contact Form

At the bottom of the page, there's a contact form which you can use to contact 
me. It was built using a combination of [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) 
and the fetch API in JavaScript. Please don't hesitate to use it! I would love 
to hear from you.

⚠️ Occasionally, the message will not send properly when using the contact form. 
In such cases, please feel free to send me an email. My email address is 
displayed on my profile.

### Featured Projects

There is a projects section which features my current best projects.

You can access the sites or apps themselves by clicking on the title of the 
project or the 'new tab' icon at the bottom of each project description, which 
will open the site or app in a new tab.

You can access the GitHub repositories for these projects by clicking on the 
GitHub logo at the bottom of each project description, which will open the 
repository in a new tab.
